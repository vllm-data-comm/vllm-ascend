"""LwdDataPlane: singleton entry point of the LWD data plane.

Compute side only ever calls ``submit_send`` / ``submit_recv`` and
consumes ``LwdTransferFuture`` notifications.  ``poll_completions`` is meant
to be invoked from an existing host loop head (worker busy loop);
it drives keepalive reclamation via lazy reap.

Ported (simplified) from the demo branch's ``lwd_comm/service.py``.
